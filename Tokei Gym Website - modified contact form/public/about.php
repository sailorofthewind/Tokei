		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<h3>Excellence</h3>
		<p>The centre is run by highly qualified martial artists, fitness experts and sports profesionals who all have many years experience in their chosen field.</p>

		<h3>Our History</h3>
		<p>The Tokei Centre was formed in 1975 primarily as a Martial Arts centre for the local community originally offering Judo and Karate classes to the local youth. Since then, the centre has moved location several times and in the process developed into London's leading centre for Martial Arts, it is one of the few purpose built Martial Arts centres in the country.</p>

		<h3>Fully Equipped Gymnasium</h3>
		<p>Ten years ago we incorporated a fully equipped gymnasium with a full compliment of cardio vascular and resistance machines, free weights and plenty of space for non equipment exercises.</p>

		<h3>Fitness Classes</h3>
		<p>Along with this and over a period of time we have introduced a vast range of lunchtime 'fitness' classes from Pilates, Yoga, Body Blitz, Boxing and more......</p>

		<h3>Martial Arts</h3>
		<p>We have some of the very best martial arts instructors on hand every day. Many of our instructors have national and international coaching experience and a high proportion of these instructors have themselves competed and been successful in competitions at the very highest level. They are now offering their experience to a new generation of martial artists that are destined to be the best in their chosen discipline. In 2004 several members of our Olympic freestyle wrestling club represented their respective countries in the Olympics. We often host the British Judo team; our ladies judo has had representatives at major National and International competitions.</p>


		<h3>Facilities</h3>
		<p>There are separate Male and Female showers and changing rooms with all amenities. We provide towels for a small charge if required. </p>


		<h3>Time Out Magazine</h3>
		<p>We would not want you to read this and think that this is a centre dedicated to crash, bang, wallop, full of blokes with broken noses Timeout Magazine described us in these terms: "....the place is refreshingly free of machismo and elitism. Beginners are welcome and there are plenty of female and junior members."</p>

		<h3>Affordable Memberships</h3>
		<p>The Tokei, as an organization, is not focussed on making huge profits. For this reason we are in the enviable position of being able to offer all our activities at affordable and competitive rates.</p>

		<h3>Tokei</h3>
		<p>A question we are always being asked is what does'Tokei' mean? Tokei is Japanese for Fighting Cockerel, a reference to one of our original sponsors.</p>
